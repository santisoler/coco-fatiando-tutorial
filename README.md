# CoCo2022: Learning how to use Fatiando tools
_by [Santiago Soler](https://github.com/santisoler/), [Agustina Pesce](https://github.com/aguspesce/) and [Andrea Balza](https://github.com/andieie)_


## About

In this tutorial weâ€™ll take a tour around
[Fatiando a Terra](https://www.fatiando.org) tools.
The project is composed by different open-source Python libraries, each one with a specific goal and set of problems that they tackle.

In this notebook we will learn how we can use the Fatiando a Terra tools to process gravity data (or any spatial data).
We will start with a real dataset of scattered gravity observations
and finally produce a regular grid of the Bouguer gravity disturbance.

## Setup

There two way to follow this tutorial:

- Use [JupyterHub](https://lab.openearthscape.org) where the notebook in this repository can be run
- Or run the notebook in your computer.

### Run it in your computer

There are a few things you'll need to run the notebook:

1. A working Python installation ([Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or Miniconda)
2. The fatiando tutorial _conda environment_ installed
3. A web browser that works with Jupyter notebooks
   (basically anything except Internet Explorer)

#### Step 1 - Install a Python distribution

In this tutorial we will be using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
Python distribution along with the `conda` package manager. If you already have
Anaconda or Miniconda installed, you can skip this step.

If not, please follow the instructions for getting Anaconda up and running in
your system: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

If you need more help to install Anaconda you can see
[this video tutorial of Software Carpentry](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#python).

#### Step 2 - Create the `coco-fatiando` conda environment

Now you could install all the dependencies through the `conda` package manager:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

And then activate the environment:

```
conda activate coco-fatiando
```

#### Step 3 - Start JupyterLab

**Windows users:** Make sure you set a default browser that is **not Internet Explorer**.

Activate the conda environment:

```
conda activate coco-fatiando
```

Start the JupyterLab server:

```
jupyter lab
```

Jupyter should open in your default web browser.
We'll start from here in the tutorial and create a new notebook together.

If you need more help to run JupyterLab you can see [this lesson of Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/01-run-quit/index.html).
